# Scraper Pro — Implementation Task List
*Prepared 2026-06-01 from `docs/planning/PROJECT-GOAL.md`, `docs/planning/PIPELINE-MASTER.md`, `docs/planning/UI-SPEC.md`, and `phases/` specs.*

---

## Purpose

This document converts the agreed design into a concrete build sequence that an agent can execute without re-planning the architecture.

---

## Current Execution Checkpoint

**Updated:** 2026-06-01

Current confirmed position:

- planning/spec alignment is complete
- `A1`, `A2`, `A3`, `A4`, `B1`, `B2`, `C1`, `C2`, `C3`, and `C4` are complete
- `C5` is complete: the live UI now reflects a real gosom-backed run entering `running` state through the app path
- `D1` is complete: typed enrichment record models and fixture validation now exist
- `D2` is complete:
  - deterministic extraction helpers cover emails, phones, JSON-LD, contact links, and conservative person-name heuristics
  - the website stage persists `enrichment_data`, `primary_email`, `primary_phone`, `primary_person`, `outreach_ready`, homepage `web.url_final`, `web.status`, and `response_time_ms`
  - website-stage state flow supports reset, atomic claim, `done/failed`, and `failed -> retry`
  - the HTTP client now falls back cleanly to HTTP/1.1 when `httpx[http2]` support is unavailable locally
  - a repo-local live proof tool now exists at `tools/live_phase2_probe.py`
  - live end-to-end proof exists against a real site:
    - `run_phase2(...)` completed successfully for `https://www.greek-flavours.com/`
    - captured output included `website_status='done'`, `primary_email='info@greek-flavours.com'`, `primary_phone='01792381143'`, `primary_person=null`, and `remaining=0`
- `D3` is complete:
  - AI fallback runs only when deterministic extraction still misses `email`, `phone`, or `person name`
  - the fallback input now contains cleaned homepage/contact-page text, metadata, and deterministic partial results
  - AI-returned values are accepted only when they include evidence with `snippet + page_source`
  - unevidenced output is discarded
  - if the AI call fails, deterministic website-stage results are preserved and only `ai_fallback_status` degrades
  - direct Groq API support is now wired, with `GROQ_API_KEY` and `GROQ_MODEL`
  - controlled tests now prove:
    - fallback can recover a missing field with evidence
    - unevidenced output is rejected
    - AI failure does not collapse the deterministic website stage
- `D4` is complete:
  - domain extraction now derives the host from `web.url_final`
  - WHOIS lookup now writes `web.whois_owner`, `web.domain_registered`, and `web.domain_expires`
  - MX lookup now writes `emails[*].mx_valid`
  - syntax-valid emails are promoted from `confidence='low'` to `confidence='medium'` only when MX is confirmed
  - `whois_mx_status` is now persisted for the stage
  - `requirements.txt` now includes `python-whois`
  - controlled tests now prove expected WHOIS and MX values on known domains
  - live end-to-end proof exists against a real site:
    - `data/live_phase4_probe.json` shows `whois_mx_status='done'` for `https://www.greek-flavours.com/`
    - the captured output includes `mx_valid=true`, `confidence='medium'`, `whois_owner='REDACTED FOR PRIVACY'`, `domain_registered='2025-07-19'`, and `domain_expires='2026-07-19'`
- `C6` remains open, but it is now intentionally non-blocking:
  - real completion and lead ingestion are already proven
  - live cap-hit subdivision is still not yet proven
  - the dense London background verification run under project `57ab8ce3-3468-4f3a-ada7-764f2ab83cde` finished `failed` without yielding cap-hit evidence
- broad live cap-hit probes can exceed the earlier 300s local wait window; the gosom client timeout policy has been adjusted accordingly
- application scaffold, env contract, SQLite bootstrap, first tests, project CRUD API, UI shell, Phase 1 gosom wiring, coverage queue logic, lead ingestion, coverage endpoints, live map UI hooks, a completed deterministic website stage, AI fallback stage, and WHOIS/MX stage now exist

**Last fully completed task:** `Track D -> Task D11 — Phase 2 verification suite`

**Canonical next task:** `Track G -> Task G1 — Environment bring-up`

**Current build block to finish before moving on:**

1. `C6` — Phase 1 verification (background verification only; non-blocking)
2. `G1` — Environment bring-up (requires user action: gosom Docker + API keys)
3. `G2` — Automated tests comprehensive review
4. `G3` — Real integration test (end-to-end live run: Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → leads.xlsx)
5. `G4` — Documentation closeout

**Current stop point rule for future sessions:** when a session ends, update this section with the exact last completed task and the exact next task. Do not leave the finish point implicit.

It is for **v1 only**:

- Phase 1 — Discovery
- Phase 2 — Enrichment
- Phase 3 — Normalise, dedup, export

Explicitly **out of scope**:

- Phase 4 — Web & Presence Audit
- Phase 5 — Lead Scoring
- Yell top-up
- Experimental OSINT expansion

The source-of-truth docs remain:

- `docs/planning/PROJECT-GOAL.md` — product objective and scope
- `docs/planning/PIPELINE-MASTER.md` — schema, API, orchestration, file structure
- `docs/planning/UI-SPEC.md` — UI contract
- `phases/phase1-discovery.md`
- `phases/phase2-enrichment-design.md`
- `phases/phase3-normalise-dedup.md`

This file is the **execution plan**, not a replacement for those specs.

## Build Rules

1. Build the exact v1 contract already documented. Do not widen scope mid-build.
2. Keep checkpoint/resume semantics universal.
3. Deterministic extraction always runs before Groq fallback.
4. Preserve evidence for all AI-recovered values.
5. Deduplicate by Google CID only in v1.
6. Treat uncertain enrichment conservatively. Unknown is acceptable; invented certainty is not.
7. A phase is not complete until it has:
   - implementation
   - API wiring
   - UI visibility
   - verification tests
   - one real run against sample data

---

## Critical Risk Decisions To Implement

These two areas must be implemented deliberately because they can silently degrade output quality.

### 1. SMTP verification: throughput and false negatives

Problem:

- SMTP probing is slow by nature
- Some mail servers greylist, tarp it, refuse VRFY/RCPT checks, or silently drop connections
- A failed SMTP check must not automatically mean the email is invalid

Implementation rules:

1. Hard cap SMTP probes at `1 probe/second` globally for v1.
2. Add `5s` backoff after connection refusal or server disconnect.
3. Never retry the same address in the same run.
4. Distinguish:
   - `smtp_verified_true`
   - `smtp_verified_false`
   - `smtp_unverifiable`
5. Do not downgrade a syntactically valid + MX-valid address to unusable just because SMTP probing was blocked.
6. Preserve separate fields for:
   - syntax validity
   - MX validity
   - SMTP result
   - final confidence
7. Use SMTP to raise confidence, not as the only gate for retaining an email.

Acceptance rules:

- SMTP-disabled or hostile mail servers must not collapse email coverage.
- Emails with `MX=true` and `SMTP blocked/error` must remain usable with lower confidence.
- The pipeline must expose counts for verified vs unverifiable vs rejected.

### 2. Companies House matching: messy business names

Problem:

- Google Maps names are often noisy, branded, shortened, or location-qualified
- Companies House legal entities are often different from trading names
- Bad matching can attach the wrong owner or company number to the lead

Implementation rules:

1. Build a **tiered matcher**, not a one-shot fuzzy search.
2. Match in this order:
   - exact normalized name match
   - normalized match after stripping suffix noise
   - postcode-aware shortlist match
   - website/domain-supported match
   - conservative fuzzy fallback
3. Normalization must strip or standardize:
   - case
   - punctuation
   - `Ltd`, `Limited`, `LLP`, `Limited Liability Partnership`
   - trading prefixes/suffixes like city names where clearly decorative
   - repeated whitespace
4. Prefer candidates that agree on:
   - postcode or locality
   - website/domain clues
   - category plausibility
5. Store a `match_confidence` and `match_method`.
6. If ambiguity remains, leave Companies House data blank and mark the lead for review instead of forcing a match.
7. Never attach officers/PSC/financials from a low-confidence company match.

Acceptance rules:

- Wrong-company attachment rate must be biased toward zero, even if recall drops.
- Ambiguous matches must be visible in UI/API.
- Sample validation against messy local business names must be performed before phase sign-off.

- UI reflects live progress correctly

#### Task G4 — Documentation closeout

Update after implementation:

- `docs/agent/AGENT.md`
- `docs/ops/SESSION-LOG.md`

## Git Closeout Rule

At the end of each coherent work block:

1. update the checkpoint section above
2. update `docs/ops/SESSION-LOG.md`
3. update `docs/ops/HANDOFF-NEXT-SESSION.md` if the resume point changed
4. commit with action, reason, and decision context
5. push the checkpoint to GitHub unless explicitly told not to
- handoff doc
- run instructions

Done when:

- the next agent can start from the built system rather than re-reading all planning docs

## Recommended Build Sequence For Next Session

1. Foundation: A1-A4
2. Core API/UI shell: B1-B2
3. Phase 1: C1-C6
4. Phase 2 data model and deterministic extraction: D1-D4
5. Risk-sensitive enrichment pieces: D5-D6
